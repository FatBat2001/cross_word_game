 Used some of the algorithms I learned, such as: <br>-Depth-First-Search <br>-Backtracking<br>-Trie data structure<br>
 I used the Trie datastrucre to guide the search to reduce the time complexity instead of the brute force approach<br>
 Used the backtrack algorithm to construct all subsequences of words in the grid (which are available in the trie) 
<br> The code is well commented I've also included some screen-shots to understand the game concept if you don't know corss-words puzzle
