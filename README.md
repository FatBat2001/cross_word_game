# Used some of the algorithms I learned, such as: <br>Depth-Firt-Search <br>Backtracking<br>Trie data structure<br>
I used the Trie datastrucre to guide the search to reduce the time complexity instead of the brure force approach<br>
Used the backtrack algorithm to construct all subsequences of words in the grid (which are available in the trie) 
<br>The code is well commented I also put some screen-shots to understand the game concept if you don't know what cross-words puzzle is
